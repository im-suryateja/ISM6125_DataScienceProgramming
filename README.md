# ISM6125_DataScienceProgramming

I have studied a broad range of machine learning and deep learning topics, and I have created several notebooks that cover various aspects of these subjects. I began with the basics of Python programming and then moved on to more advanced machine learning techniques, such as decision trees and ensemble methods. Later, I explored text mining, neural networks, and deep learning concepts like autoencoders and convolutional neural networks. I also learned about recurrent neural networks, which are useful for working with sequential data. The course concluded with a final lecture that summarized the key takeaways from each topic covered. Overall, I believe that I now have a solid understanding of machine learning and deep learning, which will enable me to tackle a wide range of real-world problems.
